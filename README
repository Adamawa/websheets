websheets: Online version of coding handouts with blanks
========================================================

How to use:

- the user should visit ws.php
- you can pass arguments to restrict to a certain set of exercises / a default exercise:
e.g. http://.../websheets/ws.php?group=HelloWorld+NameAge+NextYear#NameAge
makes three exercises shown, of which the second one is shown upon landing.

How to define more exercises:

- follow the examples in the "exercises" directory. They are essentially 
key-value string pairs, written as python modules only because this makes
less escaping necessary.

Here is an abbreviated version of how to install websheets on your computer.

1) Install https://github.com/cemc/safeexec (follow instructions therein)
2) Install https://github.com/daveagp/java_jail (follow instructions therein)
3) Now clone the websheets repo, as well as its submodules
4) Setup config.json (see below)
5) Create the db table (see below)
6) Edit definition of java_prefix in config.py to however you like to securely run java

Here's the db table format:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ws_history` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `user` varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `problem` varchar(100) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `submission` varchar(5000) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `result` mediumtext COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `time` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `passed` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `authdomain` text COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `user` (`user`,`problem`,`passed`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

config.json is a json-formatted file, variously loaded by php and python,
that contains all the secrets that are specific to your setup. it should
look like this if you want to use Google and Facebook:

{
        "hybridauth-base_url":"http://your-server.../websheets/hybridauth/hybridauth/index.php",
        "db-host": "...",
        "db-user": "...",
        "db-password": "...",
        "db-database": "...",
        "facebook-id": "your facebook api id",
        "facebook-secret": "your facebook api secret key",
        "google-id":"your google api id",
        "google-secret":"your google api secret key"
}
