WRITING NEW WEBSHEET EXERCISES

The simplest kind of websheet consists of 
- a program that you wrote
  plus areas you want to blank out for the student to fill in
- tests
- an html description of the exercise

WRITING THE PROGRAM AND INDICATING BLANKS

For composing exercises, use the delimeters \[ ... ]\ to indicate a 
part of the reference solution that should be left blank for the student
to fill in. It should take one of two forms:
(1) starting and ending on the same line
OR
(2) starting with \[ on a line by itself and ending with ]\ on a line by itself

In the latter case (2/multi-line), additional whitespace on the lines
containing the delimiters \[ and ]\ is currently ignored, although it
could be meaningful in a later version where Python is used.

Example: here's a refernce solution and template with two blanks for the 
student to fill in.

public class Square {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = \[Integer.parseInt(args[0])]\; // convert arg to int
    // compute x squared and print it
\[
    int xsquared = x*x;
    System.out.println(xsquared);
]\
}

This leaves two blanks for the student.

FANCY STUFF

You can use \hide[ ... ]\ to have the code that we run on the server include
parts that the student won't see. E.g., see {example}.

You can use \fake[ ... ]\ to display read-only text to the user pretending
it is part of the program, but that won't actually be included. 
E.g., see {example}.

You can use \[ blah \show: foo ]\ to have the blank initially populated
with some text (foo). Here "blah" will be the correct replacement for
foo in the reference solution. This is useful for debugging -- where
foo some buggy text and blah is a successfully debugged version of it.
E.g., see {example}.

All of these work both in single-line or multi-line format. All delimiters 
--- i.e. \hide[ \fake[ \show: --- should be on their own line (ignoring 
whitespace) if you are doing a multi-line construction.

CHEATSHEET: WHAT ELEMENTS APPEAR WHERE?

plain text:            UI (read-only),   reference solution, student solution
blanked-out (\[...]\): UI (empty blank), reference solution, inserted in stu.s.
"show" of blanked-out: UI (read-write)
\fake[ ... ]\:         UI (read-only)
\hide[ ... ]\:                           reference solution, student solution
