description = r"""
Using recursion, define a function <tt>rec_sqrt(x)</tt>
that computes the square root of <tt>x</tt>. 
We will use binary search: think of it as binary-searching 
the real line for the number $y$ satisfying $y^2=x$.
<p>We will use recursive binary search. Each time, the recursive function
should be told the target value <tt>x</tt>, as well as 
lower bounds and upper bounds for where $\sqrt{x}$ could live.
The binary search will be recursive: each recursive call cuts
the search range in half.
<p>Since <tt>rec_sqrt(x)</tt> only takes one argument, recursing on the 
"range" needs more work. 
Let's define a second function, call it <tt>rec_sqrt_helper(x, lo, hi)</tt>
that is actually recursive: it does binary search in the specified range.
<p>Then <tt>rec_sqrt(x)</tt> only needs to get things started by calling
the helper function once.
