description = r"""
This is a continuation of the problem 
<b>Knapsack</b> (read it first). 
Like in that problem, you will 
write a static method that takes two arguments,
<tt>int[] itemWeights, int capacity</tt> representing item weights
you can choose, and the maximum weight you can steal.
But this time, we ask you to <i>find</i> and print the best solution, rather
than just the weight of it. 

<p>
To help accomplish this, we pre-compute an array <tt>canMake</tt>,
 a <tt>boolean[capacity+1][numItems+1]</tt> so that <tt>canMake[j][i]</tt>
 is true if and only if we can make weight exactly <tt>j</tt> using
 a subset of the items indexed <tt>0, 1, &hellip; i-1</tt>.
<p>
Determine which items are members of this best solution.
Print out their weights in the order they appear in the input.
(We'll only test the input on instances with unique solutions,
so your outputs should exactly match ours.)
